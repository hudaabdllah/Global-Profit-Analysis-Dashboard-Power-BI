# Global-Profit-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI

This project delivers an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze global profit performance from multiple business perspectives.

The dashboard provides a high-level overview of profit by country using KPIs, treemaps, and geographic maps, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify top-performing and underperforming markets.

Drill-through and detailed views enable deeper analysis at the country level, breaking down profit by customer segment and product to uncover profitability drivers and loss-making areas.

Interactive filters and dynamic visuals support comparative analysis across segments such as Government, Enterprise, Midmarket, and Small Business, helping decision-makers optimize product strategy and market focus.

This dashboard is built to support executive reporting and data-driven business decisions through clear, actionable insights.
